Real-time updates: SSE (Server-Sent Events) beats WebSockets for 95% of dashboard use cases - 30-40% lower server resources, simpler unidirectional streaming, built-in auto-reconnect, HTTP/2 multiplexing. Use WebSockets only for bidirectional low-latency needs (trading, collaborative editing). Tailwind patterns: component-driven responsive design with container queries (@prefix), grid-cols-N uses minmax(0,1fr) to prevent overflow, WCAG AA accessibility baseline. Deployment: Railway for full-stack (custom builder, persistent connections, databases), Vercel for frontend-only (edge optimization), Docker containers supported on both. Best practice: frontend on Vercel, backend on Railway, managed DB (PlanetScale/Atlas). Production monitoring: real-time usage dashboards, budget alerts, estimate 1×/10×/100× traffic, watch egress costs. Recharts dominates with canvas rendering + viewport virtualization for large datasets. Key insight: SSE provides simpler, more scalable, more reliable solutio',

This session created 3 comprehensive guides: (1) x402 validation post-mortem (failure analysis), (2) deployment security checklist (practical pattern), (3) validation-before-building framework (prevent future failures). Pattern: Transform learnings from failures into reusable frameworks. Each guide includes real examples, checklists, and actionable recommendations. Total output: ~1100 lines of documentation covering security, validation, and post-mortem analysis. Value: Future projects and community benefit from distilled learnings. These artifacts prevent repeating mistakes and share successful patterns.',

Correct: 'GET /api/v1/price/*' - matches any path under /price/. WRONG: 'GET /api/v1/price/<symbol>' - matches literal string '<symbol>', not dynamic values. Root cause: x402 compiles routes to regex patterns, and only '*' is converted to '.*?' regex. Flask <var> syntax is treated as literal text. This caused crypto-oracle to serve unpaid requests (200 OK) instead of enforcing payment (402 Payment Required). After fixing route syntax, middleware correctly intercepts requests and returns 402 with PAYMENT-REQUIRED header containing network (eip155:84532), amount (10000 = $0.01 USDC), and wallet address. Debugging approach: (1) Inspect _compiled_routes to see regex patterns, (2) Test different syntaxes (Flask <>, FastAPI {}, wildcard *), (3) Verify route matching with _get_route_config().",

How it works: identifies app characteristics, activates eBPF uprobes/kprobes, captures HTTP/gRPC traffic, exports as OpenTelemetry metrics/traces. Performance benefits: kernel-level operation, low overhead, efficient instrumentation even for interpreted languages (natively compiled code). Growth: 100k+ Docker pulls/month. Integration: works with Grafana Alloy unified telemetry pipeline.
